# MoonWorks Dear ImGui renderer

This project is a [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) renderer for [MoonWorks](https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/MoonWorks), a free cross-platform game development framework.

About self-explanatory, really :P

## How build?

1. `./setup.sh`
2. `dotnet run --project MoonWorksDearImGui`

Should also work on Windows, though you will need to do the things the `setup.sh` does manually.
